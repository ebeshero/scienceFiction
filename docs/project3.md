# Digital Project 3: Time-mapping Alternate Realities

### due: TBD

{% include embed.html %}

Science fiction often takes an explicit point of departure from historical events, and sometimes as in *Watchmen*, historical time is altered to fit an alternate timeline. This assignment asks you to investigate historical events relevant to specific texts we are reading. Beginning with *Watchmen* and continuing with the *Handmaidâ€™s Tale*, construct a digital record of the interweaving of historic events with events in our science fiction texts. Work with [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) and the [TimeMapper](http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/) visualization software. 


### Tech you need: 
* You will need a Google account to work with Google Sheets.
* [Follow my instructions and templates](timeMapInstruct.md) to prepare a Google Sheet file and TimeMap

You will need to share links to two resources:
1. your Google Sheet 
2. your TimeMap 
[where? CW discussion board?]
