# Science Fiction Research Project
## Analytical or Creative
### due: Tues. 12-5 by 11:59pm

You may choose to take one of two options for this assignment. Either write an analytical paper or make a creative adaptation. Both options require research, as described below.

### Option 1: Analytical Research

Choose one or two texts we have read in this class this semester, and investigate a specific topic you formulate. The topic must fit within a general framework: **How does science fiction give us a strange, new, alienating experience of ourselves and our world?** Consider how one or two of our texts give us an unfamiliar point of view on one or two of the following:

* Language and communication 
* Networks and data exchange
* Limits and extensions on physical bodies
* Technological invention: plans, source code, production
* Altering source code
* Evolution, mutation, transition
* Extinction and ruin 
* Alienation and exile
* Technology in Religion

Do research to investigate theories of science fiction relevant to your topic (in more depth than we introduced in class in [my slides here](https://www.slideshare.net/ebbondar/octavia-butler-sf-liliths-brood)). Also research historical contexts, scientific inventions, technologies, important people, or social movements relevant to your topic at the time the text was written (and/or in our own time) to help determine how your chosen text(s) may be responding its cultural moment, or anticipating our own time. First, research the texts, and follow leads to contexts. Choose just one or two context to investigate in your paper. **You will need to be selective!** You probably won’t be able to cover every possible context bearing on a complex novel or series! Investigate one or two particular relevant areas intensively.  

Based on what you learn from your research, consider how the inventive, strange and new elements of your science fiction text might relate to continuing issues in our time, to what we understand of ourselves as beings who interact with our world using technology, or as beings who are shaped and modified or who can shape and modify our habitats. 

I expect you to cite and work with 4 – 6 good quality sources. (When in doubt about the quality of a source, check in with me and ask about it.) Look for scholarly articles and books on your text in the Pitt Digital Library, and seek out relevant news resources to find out more about issues and events when a text was written. You may also use scholarly articles and links that I post as background and further reading on a particular writer. **See Guidelines for Research below**.

#### Format Options:
* This may be a traditional, word-processed paper. If so, it should be 5-7 double-spaced pages, using an 11-12 point font (Times New Roman, Arial, or the equivalent). Follow MLA citation format, using parenthetical page citations (Author page) to indicate your references to passages in our science fiction readings and to the outside secondary articles or books you are citing. Refer to the [Purdue Online Writing Lab](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/) for instructions and examples of citing in MLA style and making an MLA style Works Cited page.

* Alternatively, you may develop this as a website or long blog post entry. **SUPPLY A WORD COUNT HERE.**

### Option 2: Research and Creative Adaptation

This option involves developing short science fiction narrative sketch, extended description, or dialogue between characters. It will require you to apply ideas from other writers, to work within the style and fictional world of one of our assigned writers, and to explain in a preface or postscript of about 3 pages referencing your research and explaining how you applied your reading and research to develop your creative work. 

Read and research theories of science fiction writing (such as Darko Suvin’s) or about the alternate worlds/alternate realities constructed by science fiction writers. Read articles that theorize about how science fiction writing works or engages readers. Also seek out recent books and articles that specifically discuss the work of a particular writer on our syllabus in relation to significant issues in science fiction. Do research in the Pitt Digital Library on science fiction writing as well as on one particular writer whose work you admire or wish to model and adapt. Use at least three sources. 
	
 Now, try your hand at developing a science fiction story or dialogue of your own written in the style of one of the science fiction writers we have read in the course. This is really an academic exercise in writing something like “fan fiction.” Most likely this will not be publishable work, but rather it is intended to be a learning process and perhaps a stepping stone for you if you’re thinking of seriously writing and publishing science fiction in the future. (Published science fiction texts often take many years to germinate and develop. This assignment is simply an introduction to a thinking process involved in writing in an alternate world.)

Keep this creative sketch fairly concise, 5-8 double-spaced pages. Focus on developing a simple plot and characters by way of introducing them and their world to us. 

Options for building on the works of others:
•	Work within the domain of an existing fictional world in one of our assigned readings this semester. Invent a new character, or expand or build up a character who is fairly undeveloped within the writer’s work.  
•	Write a new episode for a science fiction text that involves immersing an already developed character in a new domain or setting, or with a new kind of technology consistent with the world of the science fiction text you are modeling. In this option you’re building an internal space within a larger construction: This space must be shown to fit in some way within the original structure of the science fiction world, but it must be a distinct domain within it, with its own rules and rituals, the revealing of which is your goal in your work of creative description or narrative.
You may write a narrative (a plot or storyline), or a dialogue between characters, or focus on developing a passage of description. In choosing your approach and developing it, work within the style of your science fiction writer. (Consider: How does dialogue appear in the text, what kinds of voices and turns of phrase sound true to the characters? What kinds of details help to develop a sense of a strange new place?) 

Finally, when you’ve finished your work, write a framing, introductory essay of about 2-3 pages in which you comment on how you have built upon and are responding to ideas from your reading of articles and essays about fantasy, and comment on the experience of writing within a “secondary” or alternate world in science fiction that is distinct from our reality. Quote from your own work as you reflect on the implications of what you have accomplished, in order to show me how you are responding to the theories and practices of writing fantasy that you have learned in this course. 

#### Format Options:
* DEVELOP THIS: CREATIVE MULTIMEDIA with TEXT / BLOG PREFACE
* Traditional word-processed format
Follow MLA citation format in your framing essay, using parenthetical page citations (Author page) to indicate your references to passages in our science fiction readings and to the outside secondary articles or books you are citing. Refer to the [Purdue Online Writing Lab](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/) for instructions and examples of citing in MLA style and making an MLA style Works Cited page.
