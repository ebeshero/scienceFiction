<h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>In this course we investigate science fiction as “literature of ideas” that speculates about what strange new beings we might become, what mechanical forms we might invent for our bodies, what networks and systems might nourish or tap our life energies, and what machine shells might contain our souls.</p>  
       <p> Our course looks backward on “speculative fiction” from a twenty-first-century vantage point and highlights motifs and milestones that speak to our moment in especially provocative ways. We will be investigating a set of challenging readings that break with conventional approaches to plot and characterization, so we can see how science fiction can work as an inventive approach to literature. In taking this course I hope you will discover many parallels to science fiction films, TV series, and texts not on this syllabus. My goal is to provide you a selection of foundational and groundbreaking texts in this most time-sensitive of literary genres with a strong emphasis on the recent past, to give you an educated frame of reference for exploring and enjoying science fiction on your own.</p>
