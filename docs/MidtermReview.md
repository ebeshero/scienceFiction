# Midterm Exam Review Guide

The exam will be "take-home" and is to be written individually. You will have a choice of essay topics, which will be posted by Sunday evening, and due via Courseweb upload by the end of the day on Tuesday, October 17. 

The exam will require you to write about each of the books we have read so far in the course, in the context of the essay topics you choose. One or two questions may ask you to work with a posted context reading and apply it to passages in our SF readings.
