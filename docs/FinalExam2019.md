### Long Essay Section (30 points) 
*Choose **one question** below to respond to in a multi-paragraph essay. You may want to take a few minutes to focus on the question and quickly outline your response and locate passages from the readings you’d like to use for support before you begin writing. Support your points by referring to specific characters, examples, and episodes from the readings. Accuracy, specificity, and reflection are key to doing well with this section.*

1. In her book, *Deconstructing Starships: Science, Fiction and Reality*, Gwyneth Jones proposed that science fiction is a thought experiment, in which the science fiction writer investigates a "what if" question by setting up controlled conditions in the plot. Let's investigate that idea and consider how it might apply to a science fiction game from the itch.io series we explored and to a novel⁠—either *Snow Crash* or a passage of *Lilith's Brood*. Consider how one or two main characters in the narrative of the game and in the novel investigate a question, and test conditions and limits on their environments. What controlled conditions do the authors set up for the experiments the characters must conduct? Finally, consider to what extent the experience of game play alters the dimensions of the experimentation we find in science fiction. How does a game invite you as the player to conduct experiments in the controlled conditions of the game and its characters, and how differently do novels vs. games present the experiments we associate with science fiction? 


2. Following your experience with analyzing science fiction games on itch.io, consider how you might construct a video game scenario involving the main characters and important events in either *Lilith's Brood* or *Snow Crash*. In your essay, sketch out a game scenario that represents a portion of the world of the novel you've chosen, and explain how you would engage a game player in a challenging scenario that reproduces in some way that is consistent with the novel a key theme, event, or crisis scenario. Your planned adaptation will be evaluated for its precision in selecting details and events from the novel, and its reflection on how to adapt these to an interactive game environment.
