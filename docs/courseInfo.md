### Course description
Science fiction is a time-sensitive subject in literature. Usually (but not always) futuristic, science fiction speculates about alternative ways of life made possible by technological change, and hence has sometimes been called **“speculative fiction”**. Like fantasy, and often associated with it, science fiction envisions alternative worlds with believably consistent rules and structures, set apart somehow from the ordinary or familiar world of our time and place. Distinct from fantasy, however, science fiction places emphasis on **technologies** as transforming the conditions of our existence and changing what it means to be human. Science fiction as “speculative fiction” is the genre that considers what strange new beings we might become—what mechanical forms we might invent for our bodies, what networks and systems might nourish or tap our life energies, and what machine shells might contain our souls.
 
This course looks backward on “speculative fiction” from a twenty-first-century vantage point. My choices in texts are certainly not the only good science fiction in the known universe, but they do represent important milestones that speak to our moment in especially provocative ways. We will be investigating a set of challenging readings that break with conventional approaches to plot and characterization, so we can see how science fiction can work as an inventive approach to literature. In taking this course I hope you will discover many parallels to science fiction films, TV series, and texts not on this syllabus. My goal is to provide you a selection of foundational and groundbreaking texts with a strong emphasis on the second half of the twentieth century, to give you an educated frame of reference for exploring and enjoying science fiction on your own.
